# Portfolio Page

This page contains some of the projects I've been working on.

This page also contains my contact.

This portfolio was one of the first pages I created when I was learning responsive web development (basics), now I mainly update it with some of the new projects (and recently received certificates).

Did major refactoring (renamed classes according to BEM naming convention, cleaned code a lot compared to the first time I created it).
